# Student-Score-Analysis

🔍 Project Overview


This project analyzes student performance data to uncover trends, insights, and potential areas for academic improvement. It uses Python and data visualization libraries to draw meaningful interpretations from raw score data.

🧰 Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

numpy for numerical operations

sklearn (if applicable) for correlation or prediction models

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes student records such as:

Names or IDs

Subject-wise scores

Total and average scores

Performance metrics like pass/fail, grade categories, etc.

(You can add the source or upload a sample CSV if it's not sensitive.)

📈 Key Insights
Here are some insights derived from the analysis:

Top Performers Identified – Students with the highest total and average scores were highlighted.

Subject-Wise Analysis – Visualizations were used to compare performance across subjects.

Score Distribution – Histograms and box plots show the spread and central tendency of marks.

Fail Rate – Number of students below the passing threshold was calculated.

Correlation Matrix – (Optional) Checked how scores in different subjects are correlated.

🖼️ Sample Visualizations
Bar plot for student totals

Line chart showing trends over assessments

Box plots for subject-wise performance

Heatmap (if correlation used)

✅ Features Implemented
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Dynamic calculation of total/average scores

Visualization of performance trends

Conditional formatting (e.g., students below threshold)
